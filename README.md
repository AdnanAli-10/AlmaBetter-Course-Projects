# AlmaBetter-Course-Projects
This repository includes all the projects involved in the AlmaBetter full stack data science specialization course.
This repository is created to store all the projects invloved in the course at one place, visible to everyone.
By sharing this I don't intend to violate the rules set by almabetter, and I hope my fellow data scientists will use my files just as a reference or inspiration and not as a source to escape from their project work.
Suggestions and ideas about any topic is always appreciated.
